					<h3 class="title">Movement as a Function of Young Children’s Engagement with Nursery Rhymes in Oral, Print, and Digital Media</h3>
					<p class="abstract"><br>First read or sung to babies, then physically enacted by toddlers and young children, nursery rhymes enter our psyche to form a basis for language understanding grounded in orality and physicality. Traditionally presented orally, nursery rhymes are today used for entertainment and educational purposes in print and in digital media. Studies in neurobiology substantiate the importance for children’s development of the type of physical activity engaged in through enactment of nursery rhymes. Because of young children’s physical limitations, and because of (until recently) the minimal physical engagement provided by digital environments for young children, the physical engagement that has been an integral part of oral and print presentations of nursery rhymes for generations, exists only minimally in their presentation in today’s digital environments. This paper presents preliminary findings on the nature of children’s physical engagement with nursery rhymes in oral, print, and digital media as a first step to creating a matrix of best practices on which to build a model of engagement with digital games that uses movement in contextually relevant ways. In this way it looks to support the growing awareness of the importance of physical engagement in children’s development and learning.</p>
